## Fullstack Open Part 5 - Exercise 5.21

## usage

Run frontend in development mode with _npm start_

Start server to port 3005 with _npm run server_

### Notes!

Original Github Custom-hooks entry (as of 2019-06-24) did not include the server component, 
this was created with JSON-Server and should be ready to go on this version. Eslint also
integrated as well as the rules that were used for this.
